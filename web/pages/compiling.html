<h1>Compiling NFS-GANESHA</h1>Since version 1.0.1, there are different way of compiling NFS-GANESHA<br><br><br><h2>Producing a statically linked daemon<br></h2>You have to specify a FSAL name when compiling. If none is provided, then
FSAL/PROXY will be used. The name you can use are POSIX, SNMP, PROXY
and FUSE<br>Example: compiling NFS-GANESHA with FSAL/POSIX <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&gt; ./configure --with-fsal=POSIX<br>&gt; make<br>&gt; make install</div>This way of compiling is the one used for all 0.99.xy releases.<br>In the NFS-GANESHA packages, the binary whose names is similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">xfs.ganehsa.nfsd</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">posix.ganeshell</span> are compiled this way.<br><br><h2>Producing a dynamically linked daemon</h2>Procedure is very similar as the one stated above, you just have to add option <span style="font-style: italic;">--enable-buildsharedfsal </span>when using ./configure<br>Example: compiling NFS-GANESHA with FSAL/XFS and dynamic FSAL<br> <div style="margin-left: 40px;">&gt; ./configure --with-fsal=XFS --enable-buildsharedfsal <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>&gt; make<br>&gt; make install</div>This will produce a dynamic FSAL library and a NFS-GANESHA daemon linked with this dynamic FSAL. This feature is available since release 1.0.1 . FSAL compiled as shared library are pretty useful when used with FSAL-less NFS_GANESHA daemon<br><br><h2>Producing a FSAL-less daemon</h2>This is available only with version 1.0.1 and later. This feature was not implemented all 0.99.xy versions.<br>This method produces the NFS-GANESHA binary with no FSAL. The daemon looks in the configuration file for the location of a FSAL library and loads it at runtime using the dlopen() API. This way, you can produce a very generic NFS_GANESHA daemon that can be used to access various filesystems. You just need to have the related FSAL to be loaded.<br>The compilation is done this way<br>
 
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&gt; ./configure --with-fsal=DYNFSAL <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>&gt; make<br>&gt; make install</div>
You will produce binaries dynfsal.ganesha.nfsd and dynfsal.ganeshell. See document about the configuration of such binaries (in the documentation section of this website) for instructions on how to use this kind of daemon.<br>
