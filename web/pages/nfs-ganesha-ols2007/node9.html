Managing the CPU resource</A>
</H2>
The second resource is the CPU. This is much easier to manage than memory.
GANESHA is massively multi-threaded, and will have dozens of threads
at the same time (most of them are ``worker threads,'' as we'll see
later). POSIX calls for managing threads help us a lot here, we can
use them to tell the Linux scheduler not to manage the pack of threads
as a whole, but to consider each of them separately.<A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="index.php?page=nfs-ganesha-ols2007/footnode#foot166"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../../images/footnote.png"></SUP></A> With a multi-processor machine, such an approach
will allow the workload to ``spread across'' all of the CPUs. What is also to be
considered is potential deadlocks.  In a multi-threaded environment, it
is logical to have mutexes to protect some resources from concurrent
accesses. But having bunches of threads is not useful if most of them
are stuck on a bottleneck. Design considerations were taken into
account to avoid this situation.

<P>
First, reader/writer locks were preferred to simple mutexes. Because
the behavior of reader/
<BR>[0]writer locks may differ from one system to
another, a small library was written to provide this service (which
was a required enhancement in terms of portability).

<P>
Second, if threads share resources, this common pool could turn to a
bottleneck when many threads exist together. This was avoided by
allocating resources per thread. This consideration has a strong
impact on the threads' behavior, because there can't be a dedicated garbage
collector. Each thread has to perform its own garbage collection and
has to reassemble its resources regularly. To avoid congestion, some
mechanism (located on the ``dispatcher thread'' described below) will
prevent too many threads from performing this operation at the same time (a
period during which they are not available for doing their ``regular''
job).  Cache layers that require this kind of garbage collection to be
done have been designed so that this process could be divided in
several steps, each undertaken by a separate agent.  Experience ``in
real life'' shows that this solution was suitable when the number of
threads is large compared to the number of threads allowed to start
garbage collecting (60 threads running concurrently when 3 could stop
working at the same time). This experience shows that the required
memory chunk was much less that what is needed for a single request
(about 20 times the size). In this situation, the impact of memory
management is almost invisible: an incoming request finds a non-busy
thread most of the time. Side effects will only become visible under
a very large load (hundreds to thousands of requests per second).
