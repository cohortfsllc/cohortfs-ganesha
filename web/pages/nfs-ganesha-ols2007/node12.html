Dealing with huge caches</A>
</H2>

<P>
As stated above, GANESHA uses a large piece of memory to build large
caches. Data and meta-data caches will be the largest caches in
GANESHA.

<P>
Let's focus first on the meta-data cache, located in the Cache Inode
Layer. Each of its entries is associated with an entry in the
name-space (a file, a symbolic link, or a directory<A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="index.php?page=nfs-ganesha-ols2007/footnode#foot71"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../../images/footnote.png"></SUP></A>). This entry is itself associated with a related
object in the File System Abstraction Layer (see next section)
identified by a unique FSAL handle. The meta-data cache layer will map
in memory the structure it reads from the FSAL calls, and it tries to
keep in memory as many entries as possible, with their parent-children
dependencies. Meta-data cache use hash tables intensively to address
the entries, using the FSAL handle to address the entry associatively.
With the current version of GANESHA, a simple write-through cache
policy is implemented. The attributes kept for each object (the file
attributes and the content of the directories) will expire after a
configurable grace period.  If expired, they'll be renewed if they are
accessed before being erased from the cache.  Garbage collection is
more sophisticated. Because there is no common resources pool, each
thread has to perform garbage collection itself. Each thread will
keep a LRU list of the entries on which it works. A cached entry can
exist only within one and only one of these lists, so if a thread
accesses an entry which was previously accessed by another, it
acquires this entry, forcing the other thread to release it. When
garbage collection starts, the thread will go through this list,
starting from the oldest entry. It then use a specific garbage policy
to decide whether each entry should be kept or purged.  This policy is
somewhat specific. The meta-data cache is supposed to be
very large (up to millions of entries) and no garbage collection will
occur before at least 90% of this space is used. We choose to keep as
much as possible the ``tree topology'' of the name-space viewed by the
FSAL in the cache. In this topology, nodes are directories, and leaves
are files and symbolic links. Leaves are garbage collected before nodes. Nodes
are garbage only when they contain no more leaves (typically an empty
directory or a directory where all entries were previously garbaged).
This approach explicitly considers that directories are more important
than files or symbolic links, but this should not be an issue.
Usually, a name-space will contain a lot more files than directories,
so it makes sense to garbage files first: they occupy most of the
available space.  Because the cache is very large, parts of it tend to
be ``sleeping areas'' that are no longer accessed. The garbage collection
routine within each worker thread, which manages the oldest entries
first, will quickly locate these and clean them. With our workload
and file system usage, this policy revealed no problem. When the
garbage collection's high water mark is reached, the number of entries
cached begins to oscillate regularly between low water mark and high
water mark. The period of the oscillation is strongly dependent on the
average load on the server.

<P>
The data cache is not managed separately: if the content of a file is
stored in data cache, this will become a characteristic of the
meta-data cached entry. The data cache is then a `child cache' to the
meta-data cache: if a file is data-cached, then it is also meta-data
cached. This avoid incoherencies between this two caches since they are
two sides of the same coin.  Contents of the files which are cached
are stored in dedicated directories in a local file system. A
data-cache entry will correspond to two files in this directory: the
index file and the data file. The index files contain the basic meta-data
information about the file; the most important one is its FSAL handle.
The data file is the actual data corresponding to the cached file. The
index file is used to rebuild the data-cache, in the event that the
server crashes
without cleanly flushing it: the FSAL Handle will be read from this
file and then the corresponding meta-data cache entry will be
re-inserted as well, making it point to the data file for
reconstructing the data cached entry.  Garbage collection is performed
at the same time as meta-data cache garbage collection. Before
garbaging files, the meta-data cache asks the data cache if it knows
this entry or not. If not, regular meta-data garbage collection is
performed. If yes, the meta-data cache asks the data cache to apply its
garbage policy on it, and eventually flush or purge it. If the file is
cleaned from the data cache, it can be garbaged from meta-data cache. A
consequence of this is that a file which has an active entry in the
data cache will never be cleaned from the meta-data cache.  This way
of working fits well with the architecture of GANESHA: the worker
threads can manage the data cache and meta-data cache at the same time, in
a single pass. As stated above, the two caches are in fact the same,
so no incoherence can occur between them. The data cache has no
scalability issue (the paths to the related files are always known by
the caches) and does not impact the performance of the meta-data
cache.  The policy used for data cache is ``write-back'' policy, and only
``small'' files (smaller than 10 MB) will be managed; others would be
accessed directly, ignoring the data cache.  Smarter or more
sophisticated algorithms can be implemented--for example, the
capability, for very large files, to cache a region of the file but
not the whole file.  This implementation could be linked to NFSv4
improvements like NFSv4 named attributes or the use of the PNFS
paradigm (which is part of the NFSv4.1 draft protocol).
