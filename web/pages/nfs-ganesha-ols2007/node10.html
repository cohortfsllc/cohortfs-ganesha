The Hash Tables: a core module for associative addressing</A>
</H2>

<P>
Associative addressing is a service that is required by many modules
in GANESHA--for example, finding an inode knowing its parent and name,
or finding the structure related to a NFSv4 client, knowing its client
ID.  The API for this kind of service is to be called very often: it
has to be very efficient to enhance the daemon's global performance.
The choice was made to use an array of Red-Black Trees.<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="index.php?page=nfs-ganesha-ols2007/footnode#foot55"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="../../images/footnote.png"></SUP></A>  RBTs have an interesting feature: they re-balance
themselves automatically after add/update operations and so stay well
balanced. RBTs use a computed value, defined as the <I>RBT value</I> in
this document, to identify a specify contiguous region of the tree.
Several entries stored in the RBT can produce the same RBT value,
they'll reside the same area, but this will decrease the performance.
Having a function to compute ``well diversified'' RBT values is then
critical. This supposes an actual knowledge of the data on which the
value is computed. Because of this it is hard to have a ``generic RBT
value function,'' a new one is to be developed for each use.

<P>
Bottlenecks could occur if a single RBT is used: several threads could
perform add/update operations at the same time, causing a conflicting
re-balance simultaneously. It then appears that RBTs are to be
protected by read/writer locks and this could quickly become a
bottleneck.  Working around this issue is not difficult: using several
RBTs (stored in an array) will solve it. If the number of RBTs used is
large (more than 15 times bigger) that the number of concurrent
threads that can access them, the the probability of having two of them
working on the same tree becomes pretty small. This will not use more
memory: each of the 15 (or more) trees will be 15 times smaller than
the single one would have been.  There is an inconvenience: an
additional function is required to compute the index for the RBT to be
used. Implementing two functions is then needed for a single hash
table: one for computing the index, the other to compute the RBT
value. They must be different enough to split data across all the
trees. If not, some RBTs would be very small, and others very large.
Experience shows that specific non-regression tests were necessary to
check for the ``independence'' of these two functions.
