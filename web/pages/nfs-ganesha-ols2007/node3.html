<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
A few words about NFSv4</A>
</H1>

<P>
NFS in general, and more specifically NFSv4, is a central aspect to
this paper. People are often familiar with NFS, but less are aware of
the features of NFSv4.

<P>
NFSv2 was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984. It showed limits and
this lead to the birth of NFSv3, which was designed in a more public
forum by several companies. Things were a bit different with NFSv4.
The protocol has been fully developed by an IETF working group (IETF
is responsible for standardization of protocol like IPv4, IPv6, UDP,
TCP, or ``higher-level'' things like FTP, DNS, and HTTP). The design
began with a birds-of-a-feather meeting at IETF meetings. One of the
results was the formation of the <I>NFS version 4</I> working group in
July, 1997.

<P>
Goals of the working group when designing the protocol were:

<UL>
<LI>improve access and performance on the Internet;
</LI>
<LI>strong security with negotiation built into the protocol;
</LI>
<LI>easier cross-platform interoperability;
</LI>
<LI>the protocol should be ready for protocol extensions. 
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
NFSv4 integrates features that allow it to work correctly on a WAN,
which is a network with low bandwidth and high latency. This is done through
using experience obtained with protocols like WebNFS. NFSv4 will
then use compound requests to limit messages and send as much
information as possible in each of them. To reduce traffic, the
caching capability were truly extended, making the protocol ready for
implementation of very aggressive caching and an NFSv4 proxy server.

<P>
Scalability and availability were improved, too; a strong stateful
mechanism is integrated in the protocol. This is a major evolution
compared to NFSv2 and NFSv3, which were stateless protocols. A complex
negotiation process occurs between clients and server. Due to this,
NFSv4 can allow a server with a strong load to relocate some of its
clients to a less busy server. This mechanism is also used when
a client or server crash occurs to reduce the time to full recovery on
both sides.

<P>
Security is enhanced by making the protocol a connection-oriented
protocol. The use of RPCSEC_GSS is mandatory (this protocol is an
evolution of ONC/RPC that supports extended security management--for
example the krb5 or SPKM-3 paradigm--by use of the GSSAPI framework)
and provides ``RPC-based'' security. The protocol is
connection-oriented, and will require TCP (and not UDP like NFSv2 and
NFSv3), which makes it easier to have connection-based security.

<P>
The structure and semantics of NFSv3 were very close to those of UNIX.
For other platforms, it was difficult to ``fit'' in this model. NFSv4
manages attributes as bitmaps, with absolutely no link to previously
defined structures. Users and groups are identified as strings which
allow platforms that do not manage uid/gid like UNIX to interoperate
via NFSv4.

<P>
The protocol can be extended by support of ``minor versions.'' NFSv4 is
released and defined by RFC3530, but evolutions are to be integrated
in it, providing new features. For example, the support of RDMA, the
support of the PNFS paradigm, and the new mechanism for ``directory
delegation'' are to be integrated in NFSv4. They will be part of NFSv4.1,
whose definition is in process.
