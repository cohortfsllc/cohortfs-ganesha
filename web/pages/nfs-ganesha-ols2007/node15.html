<H2><A NAME="SECTION00052000000000000000">
The POSIX-based FSAL</A>
</H2>

<P>
This flavor of FSAL uses the regular POSIX calls (<I>open</I>, 
<I>close</I>, <I>unlink</I>, <I>stat</I>) from LibC to manage file
system objects. All the file systems managed by the machine on which
the daemon is running (depending on its kernel) will be accessible via
these functions; using them in GANESHA provides generic NFS access to
all of them.  The inconvenience is that POSIX calls often use the
pathnames to the objects to identify them. This is no persistent
information about the object (a rename could be performed on it,
changing its name). This does not fit with the pre-requisite to build
FSAL, as described in the previous subsection. Another ``more
persistent'' identifier is to be found.  The choice was made to use an
ancillary database (basically a PostgreSQL base) to build and keep the
identifier we need. The tuple (inode number, file system ID, ctime
attributes) is enough to fully identify an object, but the name should
be used to call the POSIX functions. The database will keep parenthood
relationship between objects, making it possible to rebuild the full
path to it, by making a kind of ``reverse lookup'' when needed. SQL
optimization and pathname caching were used a lot in the module. A complete
description of the process would require a full paper.  Why develop
such a module when it could be much easier to use the NFS interface in
the kernel?  The answer is linked with the resource we use at our compute
center.

<P>
GANESHA can access more file systems than most available kernels at our
site.  We had the need to access the LUSTRE file system, but some
machines were not LUSTRE clients. In most cases, they are not Linux
machines.  We strongly needed them to be able to access the LUSTRE
name-space. This could not be done via NFS kernel support: this NFS
implementation uses the VFS layer a lot, a part of the kernel that is
often bypassed by the LUSTRE implementation for optimization. This
approach, using the simple POSIX calls to access LUSTRE from GANESHA,
was quick to write and not very costly.

<P>
This module is available.
