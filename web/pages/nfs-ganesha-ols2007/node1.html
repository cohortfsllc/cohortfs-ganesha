Introduction</A>
</H1>
NFS is a well known and venerable network protocol which is used
widely. NFSv4 is the latest version of the protocol. It fully
reconsiders its semantic and the way NFS can be used.

<P>
We manage a huge compute center at CEA. In the past three years, we
had to face a strong increase in the amount of data produced by our
supercomputer, up to tens of terabytes a day.  Archived results and
files are stored in HPSS, a third-party vendor's HSM which had a NFS
interface. NFS fits our need well in terms of files meta-data
management, but there were several limitations in the product that
made for a difficult bridge between the HSM and NFS, and we believed it was time to
step to something new. The HPSS product has a user-space API, complete
enough to do all manipulation on files and directories. The decision
to write a brand new daemon to handle the NFS interface we needed to
HPSS was natural, but the following ideas lead the design process:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The new product should be able to manage very large data and
  meta-data caches (up to millions of records), to avoid congestion on
  the underlying file system.
</LI>
<LI>The new product should be able to provide the NFS interface we
  needed to HPSS, but should also be able to access other file systems.
</LI>
<LI>The new product should support the NFSv4 protocol, and its
  related features in term of scalability, adaptability, and security.
</LI>
<LI>The new product should be able to scale as much as possible:
  software congestion and bottlenecks should be avoided, the only
  limits would come from the hardware.
</LI>
<LI>The new product should be a free software program.
</LI>
<LI>The new product should be running on Linux, but portable to
  other Unix platforms.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
These considerations drove the design of GANESHA. This paper will
provide you with additional information about it.  The generic
architecture and the way it works will be described and you'll see how
GANESHA can be turned into a ``very generic'' NFS server (using only
POSIX calls from LibC) or a NFSv4 Proxy as well.  Information will
also be provided on the way to write packages to extend GANESHA in
order to make it manage various names-spaces.

<P>
The paper first describes NFSv4 and the technical reasons that lead to
a user-space NFS daemon. The architecture of the product is then
detailed including the issues that were met and how they were solved.
Some actual results are shown before concluding.
