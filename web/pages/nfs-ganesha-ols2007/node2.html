Why a NFSv4 server in User Space?</A>
</H1>
GANESHA is not a replacement for the NFSv4 server implemented in the
kernel; it is a brand new program, with its advantages and
disadvantages.  For some aspects, the NFSv4 server in the kernel
should be more efficient, but there are several domains (for example
building a NFSv4 Proxy server) in which the user-space approach will
provide many interesting things.

<P>
First of all, working in user space makes it possible to allocate very large
piece of memory. This memory can then be used to build internal
caches.  Feedback of using GANESHA in production showed that 4
Gigabytes were enough for making a million-entry cache. On a
x86_64 platform, it is possible to allocate even bigger memory chunks
(up to 16 or 32 GB, depending on the machine's resources). Caching
about 10 million entries becomes possible.

<P>
A second point is portability. If you write kernel code, then it will
be acquainted with the kernel's structure and it won't be possible to
port it to a different OS.  We kept Linux (i686 or x86_64) as the primary
target, but we also wanted to compile and run it on different
architectures, keeping them as secondary targets.  Most of the Free
Software Community is very close to Linux, but there are other free
operating systems (FreeBSD or OpenSolaris) and we have wanted to be
compatible with them since the beginning of the project.  Another
consideration is the code itself: something that compiles and
runs on different platforms is generally safer than a ``one target''
product. Our experience as developers showed that this approach always
pays back; it often reveals bugs that would not have been so easily
detected on Linux, because resources are managed differently.
Portability doesn't only mean ``running on several OSes,'' for a NFS
server it also means ``managing different file systems.'' The NFSv4
semantics bring new ideas that need to be considered there. The NFSv2
and NFSv3 protocols have semantics very close to the way Unixes manage
file systems. Because of this, it was almost impossible to have NFS
support for a non UNIX-related file system. One design consideration
of NFSv4 was to make the protocol able to manage as many file systems
as possible. Because of this, it requires a very reduced subset of
file/
<BR>[0]directory attributes to be supported by the underlying file
system and can manage things as simple as a FAT16 file system (which
has almost none of the attributes you expect in ``regular'' file
systems). When designing GANESHA, we wanted to keep this idea:
managing as many file systems as possible. In fact, it is possible
with the NFSv4 semantics to manage every set of data whose
organization is similar to a file system: trees whose nodes are
directories and leaves are files or symbolic links. This structure
(that will be referenced as the <I>name-space</I> structure in this
paper) maps to many things: files systems of course, but also
information accessible through a SNMP MIB or LDAP-organized data. We
choose to integrate this functionality to GANESHA: making it a generic
NFSv4 server that can manage everything that can be managed by NFSv4.
Doing this is not very easy within the kernel (kernel programming is
subject to lots of constraints): designing the daemon for running in
user space became then natural.

<P>
A last point is also to be considered: accessing services located in
user space is very easy when you already are in user space. NFSv4
support in the kernel introduced the <I>rpc_pipefs</I> mechanism which
is a bridge used by kernel services to address user-space services. It
is very useful for managing security with kerberos5 or when the 
<I>idmapd</I> daemon is asked for a user-name conversion. This is not
required with GANESHA: it uses the regular API for the related
service.

<P>
These reasons naturally lead the project to a user-space daemon. We
also wanted to write something new and open. There was already an
efficient support of NFSv4 support within kernel code. Rewriting
something else would have had no sense. This is why GANESHA is a
user-space daemon.
